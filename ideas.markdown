<h2 class="section-heading">Sea Serpent / Snake Thingie</h2>


My friend Mike showed me a snakeboard (aka waveboard). Super fun. I found about [Freelines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeline_skates) which looked even crazier, and expensive-er. Actually tried to build some (they were horrible) and then threw down the $100 for them. Guessing the company is gone now - their site is gone. Fun, really hard to learn, but ultimately just not efficient at all to get anywhere.

ANYWAY... I was wondering if something similar could be done in water and sketched up the idea with some tags from my friends. Check it out! Think it could work?
