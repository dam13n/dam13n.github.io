### General Tips

booking in advance can get you better overnight spots and make it possible to get the most out of the W, including getting to the Britannica lookout and mostly getting to Tres Torres for sunrise.

PUt any hats on a string attached to you

### Getting there

Fly to Punta Arenas. Book a bus in advance to get to Puerto Natales from the Punta Arenas airport. Several companies. Likely overnight in Puerto Natales. Recommend staying downtown (nearish the Plaza de Armas and food and shops area) or near the bus terminal. Then the next morning you can take a 7am shuttle to the park.
