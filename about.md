## I like

### Reading/Listening
I like to listen to books a lot using the [Audible app](http://www.audible.com/), and I log it on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25809992-damien-sutevski). Also, listening to lots of podcasts lately. I like:

#### legal
* **First Mondays** - casusal while technnical and good hosts; Supreme Court news, opinions, guesses and cool guests
* **Law 360's Pro Say** - brief but has fun, informal hosts and current, "interesting" legal issues
* **The Lawfare Podcast** - more formal; recordings of panels/events

#### digital security
* **Hackable?** - investigative and lay casts - would be cool to get more interviewees and attack vectors (per topic)

#### fiction
* **Steal the Stars** - well voice-acted sci-fi story
* **Fictional** - This is the elementary school librarian paraphrasing classics you. Really like.

#### News and History
* **Intercepted** - Good b/c often news is approached non-biasedly, but Scahill still gets pretty biased sometimes.
* **Hardcore History** - I really liked listening to two of the previous series on here, but now the speculative format is kinda boring now.
* **Malcolm Gladwell's Revisionist Histroy** - good topics, a jerk sometimes

### Video Games

My favorite video game is Rocket League. Some recent games I've liked are Rimworld, Brawlhalla, Stardew Valley, and Terraria. My old love is CS.
